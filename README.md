##Introduction

For the non-trekkies, a Trycorder is a portable measuring tool, communication tool, and remote-control tool for your Starship. It has been used a lot in many very popular Science-Fiction TV serie and Movies.

This is an itch I had to scratch for a long time.

I wanted a full fledged trycorder without announcements, free as a beer, and free public code.

I did'nt found what i was searching for, so I made one. 

The wish to have a full trycorder was so strong, I had to Learn Java, Learn Android-Studio, Learn Android Programming, starting with a classic "Hello World!" program, Learn Activities, Fragments, Permissions,  and the rest, and all of this Before I started a single line of my project.

After 3 long and painful months, I finally started the project, and drived it to a version 1.0, where I decided to share my fun with others.

With this Trycorder, You can do the following:
- Look, feel, and sound like the federation trycorder.
- Fits in your pocket, so you can beam out on demand.
- Scan your environment, temperature, pressure, light, magnetic, gravity, orientation,...
- Control the device by voice-command. (Press top left, and say "fire" or "beam me up" for example)
- Take pictures and recordings from your findings on new planets.
- Remote control your own starship, fire, communications, shields, transporter, viewer, ...
  (You have to provide the starship, and make sure it is on the wifi router that you use).
- Consult logs of operations. View the pictures and recordings you got back from your away mission.
- View Magnetic, Orientation, Gravity, Temperature sensors values drawn in the sensor area.
- View Phaser, Torpedo, Transporter operation in your sensor screen.
- View Shields, Communication Waveform, Tractor Beam sensor animation on your sensor screen.
- The application is usable in space, provided your phone is space-proof, and you wear a space-suit.
- The application can be adapted easily for different starships remote protocols.
- For captains only: Crew Information and Evaluation module. (to be found under logs/crew) (Contacts access)
- For the first time in versions following the 4.Pi (ie:4.3.141592) , The Trycorder is connecting with a central server who receive every orders from planetary trycorders. Those orders are logged, and executed on the server. (Some Text-To-Voice system here translate your action into an audible message on the bridge (the development computer area)) :-)
The Main Intelligence of the central server can respond to you.
- And many more to come ...

Remember: Every button has a function, and every surface is used and clickable. some functions may not be obvious, like speech recognition that you activate by clicking in the top left corner in the curve. (just try "computer fire" , "computer beam me up", "computer shields" , or read the source code for a complete list of words who trigger actions.)

Developpers
For those who write android code too, this trycorder is made of hundreds of differents examples
in the differents forums i follow. This is a good example of over-populated buttons groups, with a lot of
examples applications all mixed together, trying to look like to a useful tool.

This fantastic tool, helped me learn everything (hum! almost) in android where I had an itch for.

Now people on XDA have a fantastic toy, to play with, learn in, and impress friends.
