The new Trycorder 3.0 is in the download section on top of this page (with 2.9.7 as beta)

This is an itch I had to scratch for a long time.

I wanted a full fledged trycorder without announcements, free as a beer, and free public code.

I did'nt found what i was searching for, so I made one. 

The wish to have a full trycorder was so strong, I had to Learn Java, Learn Android-Studio, Learn Android Programming, starting with a classic "Hello World!" program, Learn Activities, Fragments, Permissions, and the rest, and all of this Before I started a single line of my project.

After 3 long and painful months, I finally started the project, and drived it to a version 1.0, where I decided to share my fun with others.

With this Trycorder, You can do the following:
- Look, feel, and sound like the federation trycorder.
- Fits in your pocket, so you can beam out on demand.
- Scan your environment, temperature, pressure, light, magnetic, gravity, orientation,...
- Control the device by voice-command. (Press top left, and say "fire" or "beam me up" for example)
- Take pictures and recordings from your findings on new planets.
- Remote control your own starship, fire, communications, shields, transporter, viewer, ...
(You have to provide the starship, and make sure it is on the wifi router that you use).
- Consult logs of operations. View the pictures and recordings you got back from your away mission.
- View Magnetic, Orientation, Gravity, Temperature sensors values drawn in the sensor area.
- View Phaser, Torpedo, Transporter operation in your sensor screen.
- View Shields, Communication Waveform, Tractor Beam sensor animation on your sensor screen.
- The application is usable in space, provided your phone is space-proof, and you wear a space-suit.
- The application can be adapted easily for different starships remote protocols.
- For captains only: Crew Information and Evaluation module. (to be found under logs/crew) (Contacts access)
- And many more to come ...

Please tell me of your success so i can add to the list of tested phones.

Remember: Every button has a function, and every surface is used and clickable. some functions may not be obvious, like speech recognition that you activate by clicking in the top left corner in the curve. (just try "fire" , "beam me up", "and others you think of..." , or read the source code for a complete list of words who trigger actions.)

The trycorder contains more than 40 operating buttons, 9 animations, dozens of sounds, around 8 sensors, speech recognition and voice interaction, and a new captains-only crew evaluation and information module, now, at version 1.9.1

Have FUN !!! 

For those who have a Force-Close on first opening, make sure your android device is setup this way.
Have Google Text-to-Speech installed and running in default us-english (and more if you need)
Have Google voice recognition active for us-english (and more if you need)
Have Google map installed (optionnal but nice to locate yourself on the current planet)
Have Location service Enabled (GPS)
Have Wifi operationnal (for info about your internet connection in the info panel, and location service)
Allow all five permissions that the application ask for.

For those who write android code too, this trycorder is made of hundreds of differents examples
in the differents forums i follow. This is a good example of over-populated buttons groups, with a lot of
examples applications all mixed together, trying to look like to a useful tool.
This fantastic tool, helped me learn everything (hum! almost) in android where I had an itch for.
Now people on XDA have a fantastic toy, to play with, learn in, and impress friends.
